        <h1 id="official--page">PCEA Sabasaba Church Facebook Page</h1>

            <li><a href="https://web.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100085118478582" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">View Page</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is the official Facebook page for our church, created on 2nd September 2022.
            The MAIN aim for this is to spread the Gospel of Jesus Christ through an online platform.
            This way we get to reach many people out there who are available on Facebook. New people 
            visiting Sabasaba town need a good church to fellowship in .
        </p>
        <p>Our church being a church town, I saw the need to advertise it for the sake of those new people who come to settle at the nearest Sabasaba
            town either for work or other things. The page displays:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Both English and Kikuyu sermons LIVE as they happen, every sunday.</li>
            <li>Motivational bible quotes.</li>
            <li>Praise and worship sessions.</li>
        </ul>
